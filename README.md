# Data Structures & Algorithms in JAVA

Data Structures and Algorithms in Java : 

This repository contains my implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Java. I created this repository as a way to practice and improve my skills in implementing these concepts in Java.

Getting Started :

To run any of the implementations in this repository, you will need to have Java and a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.

Contents :

The repository is organized into two main sections - Data Structures and Algorithms. Each section contains multiple implementations of the respective topic, along with any necessary input files or additional documentation.

How to Use :

Each implementation is contained within its own folder, with a Java file containing the implementation along with any relevant test cases. To run the implementation, simply navigate to the respective folder and compile/run the Java file.

Contributing :

I am open to contributions from anyone who would like to improve upon my implementations. If you have a better implementation or if you find any errors, please submit a pull request and I will be happy to review it.
